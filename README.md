# prediction-of-stock-price-with-LSTM

The aim is to predict the upward and downward trend of Google stock price. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm will be used to solve this problem. LSTM is a recurrent neural network architecture with feedback connections. Since RNN has a short-term memory, it cannot work well for some problems. It also suffers from the problem of gradient disappearance during backpropagation. LSTM was designed as a solution to these problems.

“While a standard RNN contains a single tanh layer, LSTMs contain 4 different layers in communication.”

A dataset containing the 5-year Google Stock Price from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2016 is used. Using this data, the trend of the stock price of the Company in January 2017 will be predicted.
